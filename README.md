# Walkable Water
This mod allows player and biters to walk on water, and or biter bases to spawn on water too. Settings are available to enable/disable players, biters and bases being able to walk on water. Combo with [Water Belts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/water-belts) mod to place some entities on water too.

### Choose your options:

- allow players to walk on water, go anywhere
- allow biters to walk on water, receive attacks from any directions (check out  [Water Belts](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/water-belts) to build defenses on water too)
- allow biter bases to spawn on water, especially if you're playing on island maps, that's some action you've missed so far!
